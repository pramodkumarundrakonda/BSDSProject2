# Java RMI Client-Server Application

This repository hosts a simple yet versatile Java RMI (Remote Method Invocation) client-server application. The application allows clients to interact with a server using RMI protocol for remote method invocation.

## Overview

The application consists of two main components:

- **Server**: Handles incoming client requests, processes them using remote method invocation, and sends appropriate responses back to the clients.
- **Client**: Interacts with the server by invoking remote methods and receiving responses.

## Features

- **Java RMI Protocol**: Utilizes Java RMI for communication between clients and the server, enabling seamless remote method invocation.
- **KeyValue Store**: The server maintains a key-value store where clients can perform operations like PUT, GET, and DELETE on key-value pairs.
- **Concurrency and Thread Safety**: The application is designed to handle concurrent client requests using thread-safe data structures and synchronization mechanisms.

## Usage

### Compilation

1. Ensure that you have the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
2. Compile the source code using the provided Makefile.
   ```bash
   make all
   ```

### Running the Server

To run the server using RMI, execute the following command:

```bash
make run-server
```

### Running the Client

Launch the client application as follows:

```bash
make run-client ARGS="<client-id>"
```
for example:
if you want to start multiple instances of client, you can instantiate them like below:

```bash
make run-client ARGS="client1"
make run-client ARGS="client2"
make run-client ARGS="client3"
make run-client ARGS="client4"
make run-client ARGS="client5"
```


## File Structure

- **src/server**: Contains server-side Java source files for the RMI server.
- **src/client**: Contains client-side Java source files for the RMI client.
- **logs**: Directory for storing log files generated by the application.

## Dependencies

- The application relies on the Java RMI library for remote method invocation.
- Ensure that the necessary Java libraries are included in the classpath.

## Concurrency and Thread Safety

The application ensures thread safety and concurrency handling through the following mechanisms:

- **ConcurrentHashMap**: The server's key-value store is implemented using `ConcurrentHashMap`, providing thread-safe operations for concurrent access by multiple clients.
- **Locking Mechanisms**: Synchronization locks, such as `ReentrantLock`, are used to protect critical sections of code, ensuring mutual exclusion and preventing data corruption during concurrent operations.
- **Remote Method Invocation (RMI)**: Java RMI inherently supports multithreaded remote method invocation, allowing the server to handle concurrent client requests efficiently and safely.
